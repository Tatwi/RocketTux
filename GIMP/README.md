On my development system, this directory contains the graphic source files that I used to make the graphics for RocketTux. Due to the way Git handles "binary blobs" that frequently change, such as these files (redundancy uses a lot of drive space), I have hosted them on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0By31kDj_eHBcWHdXRlFzdnZIdUU?usp=sharing).
