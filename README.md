# RocketTux
A pengiun with a rocket pack? It sure is as awesome as you're imagining!  

RocketTux is a side scroller adventure with player-influenced random level generation. Collect and spend coins, defeat bad guys, and have fun doing it! The ultimate goal is to buy all the level components so that you may generate more iteresting levels based on your preferences (or your crazy whims).

### Development
- Status: Just begun!
- Programmed from scratch using [Crafty JS](http://craftyjs.com/).
- Based on visual art assets from [SuperTux](https://supertuxproject.org/).
- Intended as its own unique game rather than a clone of Supertux.
- Created with Linux Mint 17 on an AMD FX-8320 / R9 270 based desktop PC. 
- Tested on an [HP Chromebook 14 G4](https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/hp-chromebook-14-g4/8326221/document/c04828937).
- Optimized for Chromebooks, designed for 1280x720 resolution.
- Pull request for bug fixes welcome.

### Target Audience
RocketTux is designed for kids and light-hearted adults alike. It's not meant to be a difficult or frustrating game. Students can play the game at school and browse or modify the source code to learn more about programming. Indeed, it is possible to create this entire game on a Chromebook in ChromeOS directly, with the proper apps! 

### Installation
RocketTux is built as an "HTML5 web app" for the Chrome browser, optimized to run well on basic Chromebooks. Until version 1.0 is complete and the game is added to the Google Chrome Store, you can download a copy of this repository, unzip it, and add it to Chrome like so:

#### Enable Flags
- Go to chrome://flags.
- Find "Experimental Extension APIs", and click its "Enable" link.
- Restart Chrome.

#### Load The App
- To load the app, bring up the apps and extensions management page by clicking the settings icon and choosing Tools > Extensions.
- Make sure the Developer mode checkbox has been selected (this for browser extensions only, not for the entire Chromebook).
- Click the Load unpacked extension button, navigate to the folder where you unzipped the app and click OK.
- Open new tab and launch RocketTux!

Note that if you are using a "managed" Chromebook, you will need to ask an administrator to add RocketTux for you. 

### Controls
- The idea is to collect as many coins as you can. You have a limited amount of boosts and "coins jumps" to reach the high ones.
- Left/Right Arrows: Move left and right.
- Spacebar: Boost into the air.
- Up Arrow: Gain altitude when collecting coins ("coin jump"). Hover when in the air.
- Down Arrow: Hover when in the air. Do NOT altitude when collecting coins (handy for collecting a row of coins). Duck when on the ground.
